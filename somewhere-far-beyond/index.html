        <p>Dedicated to those who have lost their life to cancer, Joseph Madril's heartfelt instrumental ballad
            'Somewhere Far Beyond' was created shortly after his grandmother, Karen Madril, lost her life to stage 4
            pancreatic cancer.
            "When my grandmother was first diagnosed with cancer, it was a really complicated time for our
            family. A few years prior, my grandfather found out he had cancer, but it was detected early on and
            he was able to get the treatment he needed to get rid of the cancer. When I first found out, I thought it
            would be similar and she would be back to her normal self in no time."
        </p>
        <p>Through research, Madril learned how difficult pancreatic cancer is to diagnose. "My grandmother originally
            had mild abdominal pain for almost a year prior to her diagnosis. She had a lot of allergies to many
            different things, so she
            assumed she was eating something she was allergic to. When she changed her diet, the pain went away."
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the few months prior to her diagnosis, Madril's grandmother experienced extreme pain in her abdomen.
            "She eventually went to the emergency room because of the pain she had on her stomach. After lots of
            extensive testing, she was told there was cancer in her pancreas."
        </p>
        <p>According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), pancreatic cancer is complicated to diagnose early due to
            lack of noticeable signs or symptoms in its early stages. Signs and symptoms also are similar to other
            illnesses. "When she found out of the cancer, it was already at stage 4 and there was not much options for
            her to improve her condition. Despite heavy treatments with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, her expected
            survival rate was around one year."
        </p>
        <p>Within a year and two months after her diagnosis, Madril's grandmother passed away in her home surrounded by
            family and friends. "She fought so hard to stay with us, for our grandfather, her children and
            grandchildren." After her passing, various members of Madril's family were inspired to help with early
            cancer
            detection
            research. "One of my aunts has contributed to the Healthy Oregon Project by voluntarily donating biological
            samples. Despite our advances in technology and medicine, there is still very little known about causes of
            cancer. A lot of research goes into finding a cure for cancer, but research is also needed for early
            detection so it can be treated easily during its initial stages. Early detection of cancer can save lives.
            When it is found early, the chance of survival
            and quality of life are much higher. Especially if cancer is common in your family, a routine screening can
            save your life." Madril explains that making healthy choices in lifestyle can reduce
            the risk of cancer. "Avoid smoking, have a healthy balanced diet, be active, maintain healthy weight, and
            wear sunscreen."</p>
        <p>With the release of 'Somewhere Far Beyond', Madril hopes to spread awareness of the risks of cancer and
            further research for early screening on cancers that are difficult to detect early on. "Not only is
            pancreatic cancer
            hard to detect early, but also lung cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and so many
            others. My grandmother always helped those in need, and I want to do the same for those with similar battles
            and those at risk of developing cancer with little to no signs."</p>
