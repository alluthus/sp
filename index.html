        <p class="lead">Self interview with Joseph Madril: My new album is coming out on 18 February!</p>
        <p class="lead">This special site for the album will explain the ideas behind it–from track names to the
            artwork. Similar to <i>Memory Lane</i>, this project was made just for fun using pre-recorded elements mixed
            in with some original stuff. Compared to actual, legit musicians, this project is pretty basic and lacking
            in originality (lol). This project uses <strong>way</strong> more loops/samples than my first album. I did
            this because a lot of people were quite critical towards me using some on the first album (and the 2017 Life
            soundtrack). A lot of music today uses the same beat/loops as well, so what am I doing any different from
            them? Anyways, let's get started! Just select one of the dropdowns listed below.</p>

                        <p>The album is "self-titled" due to me not being able to come up with a good title...I
                            originally
                            was going to have <i>Memory Lane</i> self titled but I was told not to because it sounds
                            "inappropriate". I suppose based on how you pronounciate it, it possibly can be that way.
                        </p>
                        <p>My previous album and EP's were titled after a track on the project, so I figured I would
                            probably do the same with this album. None of the tracks really had a good ring to them to
                            serve as an album title and my creativity is really lacking, so I just ended up being lazy
                            with naming it <i>Alluthus</i>.</i></p>

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        <p>When I first had "Aura" (a track from <i>Memory Lane</i>) published to digital stores in
                            January 2020, I originally used the name <strong>Verso</strong> since it was the username I
                            used online. Unbeknownst to me though,
                            the name was quite popular among many artists! My release ended up mixed in to another
                            artist's discography. I released another single the next month and the same thing happened.
                            Getting the releases fixed were a pain in the rear, so I decided to come up with another
                            name for future releases.</p>
                        <p>Again due to my uncreativity, I couldn't come up with a name to use and was real close to
                            just using my real name (looking back at that now, I probably should have done that, I don't
                            know why I didn't). The "alias" <strong>Alluthus</strong> was real last minute, and I got
                            the name from one of my playable characters from <i>World of Warcraft</i>. Best part is that
                            the username was autogenerated, too.</p>

                        <p>Like with <i>Memory Lane</i>, the photo was taken on a smartphone. I wanted to take the photo
                            for this album at the same place I did for <i>Memory Lane</i>, but this year has been kind
                            of
                            dry and I took those photos during Spring, so there was more "greenery" (really, it was just
                            tall weeds since it's the desert).</p>
                        <p>For this album, I took the photos in my bedroom with a smart
                            lightbulb on a lamp. The first batch ended up real bad since initially, I put the smartbulb
                            in a
                            ceiling light fixture and it made the photos grainy since the camera was not real close to
                            the
                            light source. When I put the bulb in a lamp and propped my phone next to it, the quality was
                            a
                            lot better. As for taking the photo, I used my smart watch to tell my phone when to take a
                            photo.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards, I imported the photos to my computer, selected the best one and edited out the
                            background around me and put a solid red background behind me. Using an SVG editor, I drew
                            some squiggly lines and shapes that resemble some sort of paint splatter.</p>
                        <p>For what inspired the photo, it was Hikaru Utada's 2009 album, <i><a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_the_One" target="_blank">This Is the
                                    One</a></i>. I originally was not wearing a hoodie when taking the photos until the
                            last few.</p>

                            March since I noticed I have a bit more international listeners. <i>Memory Lane</i> was also
                            released only in North America, but its deluxe release
                            was released globally. I plan for the international version of this album to include tracks
                            that previously were region locked.</p>

                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>tranquility</strong> – This track was my first release in 2021. I made it while
                                I was at my
                                family's ranch. It features some strings, mild electric guitar, piano and wind
                                instruments. I wanted to get a
                                country-like alternative sound, but the bassoon makes it sound like a kind of song
                                for some sort of isekai anime. My younger brother has a co-writing credit because he
                                came up with the track title.</li>
                            <li><strong>wanted</strong> – Similar to <strong>tranquility</strong>, I wanted a
                                country-like alternative
                                sound, which was somewhat accomplished. The flute on the track is kind of random if I am
                                being honest. It originally was added randomly while I was seeing what sounded best, and
                                was left accidentally. I ended up keeping it though because random is cool once in
                                awhile.</li>
                            <li><strong>tale</strong> – This track was made in December 2020. And guess what? It has a
                                wind
                                instrument too. For this track, I wanted to go with a sound similar from <i>Memory
                                    Lane</i>.
                                While there is electric and bass guitar, the marimba and bassoon are again–real random.
                                I am
                                not a huge fan of the marimba if I am going to be honest, but I just kept it because I
                                was
                                too lazy to replace it. The track overall is kind of weird-sounding if I am being
                                honest.</li>
                            <li><strong>soul ashes</strong> – The uncreativity strikes again here on this track. I could
                                not come up with a title, so I just used something that sounded cool (but really the
                                title is kind of awful). This track is 100% loops, with a bit of FX effects from yours
                                truly. This was one of the last tracks to be made.</li>
                            <li><strong>relapse</strong> – No, I am not addicted to anything nor have had a relapse.
                                This track also uses a lot of samples. It's got a hip hop/R&B type of beat to it, the
                                drum kit has a huge kick to it and various synths and piano are used throughout the
                                track. The track was made while I was playing around with a new sample kit, and I ended
                                up mixing it with older kits. I have been listening to a lot of contemporary R&B music
                                lately, and
                                wanted to attempt at making something similar to today's sound, so thank God for this
                                kit!</li>
                            <li><strong>赤い糸 (akai ito, red thread of fate)</strong> – I ended up using some Japanese
                                titles for this album. I just thought it would add some "uniqueness". My Japanese is
                                very minimal, so I had to double check everything on a dictionary (shoutout to <a
                                    href="https://jisho.org" target="_blank">Jisho</a>, a Japanese dictionary my
                                Japanese teacher showed
                                me in high school). The Red Thread of Fate comes from Chinese mythology, where an
                                invisible red thread is around the finger of those destined to be their true love. The
                                title would probably make a lot more sense if there were any lyrics to be honest, but I
                                used <strong>Akai Ito</strong> because I hope to find the one someday (real cringy, I
                                know).</li>
                            <li><strong>sinner</strong> – Again, these titles really make no sense...just shows how far
                                my creativity goes. I made this song back in September 2021. It probably sounds similar
                                to tracks found on <i>Memory Lane</i> because it uses the same piano loops and drum kit.
                                This track also is purely samples/loops. As for the title, the track is kind of
                                mysterious sounding and <strong>Sinner</strong> originally was supposed to be a title
                                used in one of the <i>Memory Lane</i> tracks, so I just threw it in so it can finally be
                                used.</li>
                            <li><strong>乾杯 (kampai)</strong> – This track has some sort of dance-pop feel to it. It's a
                                very upbeat track, kind of making you want to groove out. <strong>Kampai</strong> (or
                                <strong>Kanpai</strong>)
                                translated into English means "cheers" (or literally, "empty the glass") and is said for
                                a
                                toast, like how in English, one says, "Bottoms up!" The drinking aspect aside, this
                                track to me felt kind of celebratory in its beat, hence the title. Why not celebrate
                                with some sparkling juice?

                            <li><strong>fUcK off (interlude)</strong> – This is absouletly one of the most cringiest
                                tracks I have made, <i>ever</i>. Kid you not, I was trying my best to not laugh while
                                making this. This was the very last track made, and I almost didn't include it. I kept
                                it because I already told a few people it would be included on the project. Technically
                                speaking, <strong>Fuck Off</strong> is my "vocal debut". No singing though, I am just
                                reading in a monotone voice off of my tablet. The effort in using an actual microphone
                                was not worth it, so the vocal part was recorded on my phone and basically, it's just me
                                saying, "Fuck off", multiple times. The background noise, the smacking of my lips and me
                                trying to hold my laughter in is what makes this track hillarious. Many might think what
                                I am saying on there is serious, because it mentions people indirectly, but I can assure
                                you, this was just for shits and giggles.</li>
                            <li><strong>グイグイ (GUI GUI)</strong> – Like <strong>Kampai</strong>, this track also has a
                                dance-pop influence to it, but also perhaps electropop as well. <strong><a
                                        href="https://jisho.org/search/%E3%82%B0%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B0%E3%82%A4"
                                        target="_blank">Gui Gui</a></strong> is like an
                                onomatopoeia really. Generally, it means doing something without hesitation and
                                continuously. It can also mean drinking heavily, but that is not the case for this
                                track. Theoretically, one can dance care-free to a dance-pop song with very little
                                thought to mind, so I just decided on <strong>Gui Gui</strong>. Everyone can have some
                                optimism in their life after all. The word itself though, I have
                                never heard of it before in Japanese until I <a href="https://bit.ly/3GObDTh"
                                    target="_blank">discovered it on an album</a>.</li>
                            <li><strong>24/7</strong> – This track originally was on my 2020 extended play titled
                                <i>Undertow</i>. Like the previous track, <strong>24/7</strong> is heavy on the beats
                                and synths. An upbeat track, I made it messing with newly released loop kits while
                                visitng a relative in San Diego. We were in downtown San Diego and the nightlife there
                                inspired the title.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Undertow</strong> – This was recorded while I was making the deluxe tracks
                                of <i>Memory Lane</i>. I originally made the track for a game titled "Ketchup the
                                Banana" by STiBaRC CEO Joshua Herron (herronjo), but it was something he didn't want to
                                use in the game, I think due to the track being relatively slow and "watery electric" as
                                he calls it. Herron also has co-writing credits for this track. A "remastered" album
                                version was included on this release, with clearer sounds and a bit more "oomph".
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Skyline</strong> – Also from the <i>Undertow EP</i> and also made while in San
                                Diego, Skyline is ironically one of my least favorite tracks. It isn't made very well,
                                especially near the end. The track is 100% loops as well and the title inspiration was
                                from the San Diego skyline I saw while visiting as we stayed on the 12th floor of a
                                condo with a view of the San Diego Bay.</li>
                            <li><strong>ミュージック (myūjikku, music)</strong> – I originally made this track for someone in
                                the STiBaRC Records roster, but no one wanted to use it or remix it as their own.
                                Originally titled <strong>Loops</strong>, this track uses <i>a lot</i> of samples and
                                loops. Only a tad bit of the drum kit was by me. It is also my longest published song,
                                at 4:30. The upbeat theme strikes again with this song. The original title was kind of
                                bland, so I decided to just name it "music" in Japanese.</li>
                            <li><strong>大丈夫 (daijōbu)</strong> – Honestly, the title throws you off when the track first
                                starts. <strong>Daijōbu</strong> means one is all right and safe, or informarlly, they
                                are chill. The track gives a sort of mysterious vibe with the strings found in the
                                beginning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Press Forward</strong> – From the <i>Undertow EP</i>as well, this track is very
                                "acoustic" (I put that in quotations because the guitar was made from MIDI rather than a
                                real guitar). Some of the strings are the same samples found in the <i>Life
                                    Soundtrack</i> while the "guitar" samples are the same found in <i>Memory Lane</i>.
                                For this track, I wanted a sound similar to the title track of <i>Memory Lane</i>. It
                                has a country sound to it, but Orchestra too since there is prominent strings.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>K.M.D</strong> – The title of the track is the initials of someone close to my
                                family that
                                recently passed away. This track is simply a piano track from the TRAKGIRL kit on
                                GarageBand. Near the end, I recorded a drum kit. The song is pretty minimal and short,
                                but I wanted to honor their life in some sort of way, and this was the only idea I could
                                come up with. This song was my last release of 2021.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Let Go...</strong> – This is the final track of the album. It also is 100%
                                loops/samples. The song was originally created in October
                                2021. While pretty short, I think it serves best as a closing track for the album. As
                                for the title, I kind of based it off of <strong>Epilogue</strong>, the final track from
                                <i>Memory Lane</i>. <strong>Let Go...</strong> however sounds way different.

                        <p>Not 100% sure to be honest. I said the same thing about <i>Memory Lane</i> though, and sure
                            enough, a second album has been made. It all just depends really, considering this took
                            <i>way</i> longer to make (like a year and a half) versus the 6 months it took to make
                            <i>Memory Lane</i>.
